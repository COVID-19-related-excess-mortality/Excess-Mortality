Data and maps on COVID-19 Excess Mortality in Italy

The files included in this repository are those produced for the ongoing project on the analysis of COVID-19 related excess mortality in Italy. The project is conducted by the Public Health and Biostatistics team of the Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna (https://dibinem.unibo.it/it/ricerca/gruppi-di-ricerca/unita-metodologico-statistica-e-di-ricerca-sui-servizi-sanitari).

As of January 2021, the output of the project is a paper published on Health & Place: "Patterns of COVID-19 related excess mortality in the municipalities of Northern Italy during the first wave of the pandemic", by Gibertoni, Adja et al. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829221000046)

A preprint of the same study had been published on medRxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20097964v1).

Currently, the repository includes:
- Italian regional maps of excess mortality at the municipality level for different periods and age/gender subgroups
- Italian national maps of excess mortality at the province level for different periods and age/gender subgroups
- Italian national and interregional maps of excess mortality spatial correlation for different periods and age/gender subgroups

For the methods used to obtain the maps please refer to the cited articles.
