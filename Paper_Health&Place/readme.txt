Abstract: The impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mortality in Italy has been described at the regional level, while less is known about mortality in municipalities, although the spatial distribution of COVID-19 in its first wave has been uneven. We aimed to describe the excess mortality due to COVID-19 from February 23rd to April 30th, 2020 in the three most affected Italian regions, in age and gender subgroups within each municipality. Excess mortality varied widely among municipalities even within the same region; it was higher among the elderly and higher in males except in the â‰¥75 age group. Thus, nearby municipalities may show a different mortality burden despite being under common regional health policies, possibly as a result of local reinforcements of regional policies. Identifying the municipalities where mortality was higher and the pathways used by the virus to spread may help to concentrate efforts in understanding the reasons why this happened and to identify the frailest areas in light of recurrences of the epidemic.
